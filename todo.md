1.	Data Collection:
  •	Automate running log commands or capturing system logs.
  •	Use tools like tcpdump for network data.
  •	Monitor critical files (e.g., /etc/hosts) using macfsevents or watchdog.
2.	Parsing:
  •	Normalize collected logs into JSON or CSV format.
  •	Use pandas to create structured data tables for further analysis.
3.	Storage:
  •	Use SQLite for simplicity or Elasticsearch if you plan to query large amounts of data.
4.	Analysis:
  •	Write logic to detect suspicious patterns (e.g., brute-force attempts or abnormal network activity).
  •	Incorporate machine learning for anomaly detection (optional).
5.	Alerting:
  •	Set up email alerts for significant findings using smtplib.
  •	Optionally, integrate with twilio for SMS notifications.
6.	Visualization:
  •	Use plotly or streamlit to create an intuitive dashboard for logs and alerts.
